/*
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there?

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
