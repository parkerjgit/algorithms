# Graphs

1. A graph is a set of vertices and a set of **directed or undirected** edges (u,v).
2. **Vertices and Edges** can be decorated with weights, lengths, etc...
3. A **path** is a sequence of vertices, and the **path length** is the number of edges it traverses.
4. If there exists a path from u to v, then v is **reachable** from u.
5. A **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** is a directed graph with no cycles.
6. DAG vertices with no incoming or outgoing edges are called **sources** and **sinks** respectively.
7. A **topological ordering** of vertices in a DAG is such that each edge is from a vertex earlier in the ordering to a vertex later in the ordering.
8. cont. on EPI pg 276 with basic concepts...
9. A graph can be implemented using an **adjacency list** or an **adjacency matrix**.
10. If each vertice has at most one edge, implement the *adjacency list* with a dictionary where key/value pairs correspond to u,v edge pairs (or better yet, use an array if vertices map to array indices) (see EPI 277.)
11. If vertices have multiple edges can still use dict, where dict values are lists of tuples corresponding to outgoing edges, or alternatively, maintain seperate lists of vertices and edges. May have to use multiple representations for more complex problems.
12. If using graph to model a grid, or if graph is highly connected, consider an adjacency matrix.
10. graphs are ideal for modeling **binary relationships between pairs of objects**
11. Graphs are natural for **spatial relationships**, but consider them more generally for any binary relationship between objects (e.g. links, followers, etc.)
12. Prefer **DFS** for graph problems that entail analyzing sturcture (e.g. looking for cycles, connected components, topological ordering of a DAG, etc.)
13. Prefer **BFS** for optimization problems (e.g. shortest path, minimum spanning tree, etc.), which often involve computing dist from start vertex
14. DFS and BFS both compute in linear time **O(m + n)** for m edges and n vertices (or nodes)

## Represent a graph as adjacency list, adjacency map, and adjecency matrix and convert between

```js
let node = {adj: [node2, node3, ...]}               // recursive node repr. (of spanning tree)
let node = {adj: [2,3]}

let nodeMap = {1: node1, 2: node2, ...}             // map node id to node. Req. for adjacency list/map/matrix 
let nodeMapEntries = [{id: 1, node: node1}, ...]  // don't think would ever see this

let adjList = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), ...]        // tuple repr. edge in graph. tuple should be integer tuples repr id pairs.
let adjList = [{src: 1, dest: 2}, ...]

let adjMap = {1: [2,3], 2: [4], ...}               // key/value pair maps node to its neighbors
let dataMap = {1: 100, 2: 120, ...}
let adjMap = {1: {data: 100, adj: [2,3]}}           // dodn't like this

let adjMapEntries = [[1, [2, 3]], ...]              // need to build map before, 
let adjMapObjects = [{id: 1, adj: [2, 3]}, ...]              // need to build map before, 

let adjMatrix = [[0,0,1,...], ...]                 // "1" repr. edge between nodes mapped to row & col
let data = [100, 120, ...]
let nodeIds = [1,2,3,...]
let hashFn = (nodeId) => arrayIdx
let revHashFn = (arrayIdx) => nodeId
let dataLookup = (nodeId) => data(hashFn(nodeId));
```

## Get Employee Importance

```js
function GetImportance(employees, id) {
	
	let adjMap = new Map(),
      impMap = new Map();
    
  employees.forEach(({id, importance, subordinates}) => {
      adjMap.set(id, subordinates)
      impMap.set(id, importance)
  })

  function _getImportanceDft(id) {
      
      let importance = impMap.get(id),
          subordinates = adjMap.get(id);
      
      if (!subordinates)
          return 0;
      
      return subordinates
          .map(id => _getImportanceDft(id))
          .reduce((a, b) => a + b, importance)
  }
  
  return _getImportanceDft(id)
}
```

## Validation: Does graph have cycles?

intuition:
1. first thought: if you visit a node that has already been visited, it has a cycle -> works for tree (or spanning tree!) but not any directed graph
2. better: search every spanning tree by recursively searching from every node:
    * mark nodes visited in spanning tree - if visit a node twice in spanning tree (ie subtree), it has cycle
    * mark nodes visited by function - skip nodes that have already been visited

## Validation: Is graph bipartite

## Searching: Find all Paths in Directed Graph.

## Searching: Does path exist between two nodes?

intuition: dft 

## Searching: Find Shortest Path (or path with minimum distance/cost/effort/etc between two nodes) in Directed Graph.

intuition: bft

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** for Single-Source 

DIJKSTRAâ€™S algorithm, is a *GREEDY* algorithm finds the shortest path from a node to all other nodes in a directed graph, although the search may be halted once shortest path to a target node is known. 

## Searching: Find minimum cost to connect all/muliple nodes (minimum spanning tree) in undirected graph?

see https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/

## Searching: Count number of connected components.

## Searching: Find least/most connected node (e.g. city with smalles number of neighbors)

## Sorting: Topological Sorting
