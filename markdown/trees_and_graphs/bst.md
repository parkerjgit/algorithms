# Binary Search Trees (BST)

## Implement BST with add, search, and min/max

## Traverse BST in four ways: DFT (pre-order, in-order, post-order) and BFT

## Get all root-to-leaf paths by building each path: (1) on way down, and (2) on way up

## Get all levels

## Validate and Balance BST

## Applications of BST

## BST Problems

1. Fix a BST with 2 swapped nodes. (lc 99) - perform in-order traversal, find and mark nodes in violation of bst, then fix.
1. Are 2 trees the same? (lc 100) - if roots are the same and the left and right subtrees are the same, then the trees are same.
1. Are 2 trees symmetric? (lc 101) - tree is symmetric if subtrees are mirror reflections, two trees are mirror reflections if (a) roots are same and (b) right subtree is mirror reflection of left subtree (and vis-versa).
