## Dijkstra's Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path in Directed Graph 

DIJKSTRAâ€™S algorithm, is a *GREEDY* algorithm finds the shortest path from a node to all other nodes in a directed graph, although the search may be halted once shortest path to a target node is known. 

#### Implementation

#### related problems/algorithms

A variation of this search, A*SEARCH, directs the search with heuristic information when approximate answers are acceptable.
