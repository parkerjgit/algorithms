## Recursion

---

1. Find all permutations of an array, A, by finding all permutations that begin with each element in the array, or, find all permutations that result from inserting first element into every position of all permutations of the rest of the array, i.e. A[1:]
2. Flatten a nested array by recursively searching for and appending elements to nonlocal container, (see [Nearly Flatten a Messy Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ae64f86783bb4722c0000d7))
